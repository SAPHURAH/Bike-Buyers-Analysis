Bike Buyers Analysis - Excel Data Analysis Project

 Project Overview
This project is my first step in data analysis using Excel. It focuses on analyzing customer data to uncover insights about bike purchasing behavior. The dataset includes various customer attributes such as gender, age, marital status, income, education level, occupation, and commute distance. The project involved cleaning the data, creating pivot tables, and building a dashboard to visually represent the findings.

Objectives
The main goals of this project are:
- To analyze the demographic factors (e.g., gender, age, occupation) that influence bike purchases.
- To explore customer characteristics and trends in purchasing behavior.
- To provide a clear, visual summary of the data using a dashboard.

 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following key columns:
- Marital Status: Indicates whether the customer is married or single.
- Gender: Male or Female.
- Income: Annual income of the customer.
- Education Level: The highest education level attained.
- Occupation: Customer's job role.
- Home Ownership: Whether the customer owns or rents their home.
- Commute Distance: Distance between home and work.
- Bike Buyer: Indicates if the customer purchased a bike (Yes/No).

 Methodology
 1. Data Cleaning:
   - Cleaned and categorized data, including handling missing or inconsistent values.
   - Segmented the dataset based on age groups, occupation, and commute distance.

 2. Pivot Table Analysis:
   - Age Distribution by Gender: This pivot table summarizes how customer age varies across gender categories. It reveals which age groups are more prevalent among male and female bike buyers, helping to identify target demographics for marketing efforts.
   
   - Total Cars Owned by Gender: This table highlights the number of cars owned by different genders. Understanding car ownership can provide insights into customers' lifestyles and their potential needs for bike ownership, indicating urban or rural living preferences.
   
   - Occupation Breakdown: This pivot table presents a summary of customer occupations segmented by gender. It helps assess which job roles have a higher likelihood of bike purchases, allowing for targeted marketing strategies based on occupational demographics.

 3. Dashboard:
   - Created a visual dashboard in Excel to display key insights such as:
     - Percentage of bike buyers based on occupation.
     - Gender distribution among customers.
     - Relationship between income levels and bike purchasing.

Key Insights
- Occupation Influence: Certain job roles have a higher likelihood of bike purchases.
- Income and Purchases: There is a visible trend between higher income and bike purchasing.
- Gender Distribution: Gender plays a role in the likelihood of bike purchases, with certain genders more likely to buy bikes.


Conclusion
This project helped me understand the basics of data analysis using Excel. I was able to explore the data through pivot tables and visually communicate my findings through a dashboard. This project is part of my journey to becoming a data analyst.
